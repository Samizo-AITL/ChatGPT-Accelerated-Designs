# Sky-HyEV Standard Model Communication Interface Design Specification v0.1

## 1. Overview  
This document specifies the design of the communication interfaces for the Sky-HyEV Standard Model, covering UART, I2C, SPI, and USB protocols to ensure robust and efficient data transfer among modules.

## 2. Design Scope  
- Physical layer specifications  
- Communication speeds and timing  
- Bus arbitration and multi-master handling  
- Connector types and pin assignments

## 3. Deliverables  
- Interface List  
- Timing Diagrams  
- Communication Protocol Specifications

## 4. Design Specifications

### 4.1 UART  
- Baud rates: 115200 bps (default), up to 3 Mbps supported  
- Signal levels: TTL 3.3V compatible  
- Parity: None, even, odd selectable  
- Flow control: Hardware RTS/CTS supported

### 4.2 I2C  
- Speed modes: Standard (100 kbps), Fast (400 kbps), Fast Plus (1 Mbps)  
- Addressing: 7-bit and 10-bit addressing supported  
- Pull-up resistors integrated on board  
- Multi-master arbitration implemented

### 4.3 SPI  
- Clock speed: up to 50 MHz  
- Modes: SPI mode 0, 1, 2, 3 supported  
- Full duplex communication  
- Chip select lines configurable per device

### 4.4 USB  
- USB 2.0 Full Speed (12 Mbps) support  
- Connector: Micro-B USB type  
- Power supply from USB port (5V, 500 mA max)  
- Hot-plug and unplug detection

## 5. Key Focus Points  
- Clock synchronization across all buses  
- Multi-master support with bus contention resolution  
- Interference avoidance and EMI mitigation  
- Robust physical connectors suitable for automotive environments
