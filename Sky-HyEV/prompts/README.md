# Prompt Engineering for Sky-HyEV Specification Generation

This directory contains the **prompt templates** used to rapidly generate detailed design specifications for the Sky-HyEV project using ChatGPT.

## Background

- Created to provide clear, structured instructions to ChatGPT per module
- Each template covers module name, target model (Standard/Professional/Military), expected scope, deliverables, and key focus points
- Highly reusable and adaptable for similar modules

## Usage

1. Copy the desired prompt template and input it into ChatGPT
2. Review and edit the generated response to finalize the specification
3. Adjust parameters and regenerate as needed

## Sample Excerpt

```text
Please create a design specification for the AI control chip (28nm FD-SOI) of the Sky-HyEV Professional Model v0.1. Consider PoC deployment.
â–  Scope: Architecture structure, performance, power consumption, MRAM integration
â–  Deliverables (priority order): â‘  Block diagram â‘¡ Performance indicators â‘¢ AI task mapping
â–  Key focus points: Real-time inference capability, MRAM rewrite endurance, low-latency control
